 * Intent is the general superclass for enemy actions.
 *
 * All enemies need to have a stack of intents.
 * Intents can be turn limited or infinitely long.
 *
 * Intents should be cancellable as well. 
 * 
 * All these related stuff currently are NOT covered in class.
 *
 * NOTE: attack should eventually come under the intent system. Ideally so should Physiology,
 * but that requires multiple intents interacting, which may not be easily doable.
