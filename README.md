# b@rl

Batman based roguelike focused primarily on combat. WIP. More details soon.

## About the name
A play on how @ is pronounced 'at' and also traditionally used to represent the main character in roguelikes.

## Font
Currently setup with terminal16x16_gs_ro. Best sizes etc.

## Pending stuff from the libtcod tutorial (planned/possibly needed)
1. Better monster AI -> when do they attack? when do they move?
2. Mouse based ui (needed?)
