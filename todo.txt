Enemy AI:
=========

Effects/State:
Confusion -> flail around or miss attacks
Fallen -> just fall and take time to get up
Stunned -> just stand there
Afraid -> Run in the opposite direction
Startled -> Lose turn due to sudden appearance of the b@
Miss -> When you move fast, they miss attacks -> such as jumping causes ranged attackers to miss
(DONE)

Senses:
	vision -> can be piggy backed from user vision(DONE)
	sound -> attracted to combat or things falling etc

Intents:
Attack -> player enters line of sight in the distance
Call out -> in case of evidence, seeing the player, large sound events to warn allies
Investigate -> towards sound events (can be ongoing combat, an ally calling out upon seeing the b@, other sounds like the b@ throwing something near them)
Patrol -> walk between 2 predefined points with gaps
Chatting -> bunch of units standing next to one another
Guard -> a single location/actor
Follow -> another actor at a predefied distance
Protect -> another actor at predefined distance
Overwhelmed -> suffering 1 of the effects and cannot temporarily do the intent

Enemy types:
============
Enemy weapons / gun toting villains
Enemy uniques
More Enemy type names: henchmen
Enemy equipment: thermal imaging headsets -> can see b@ on the rafters
Armored guys -> need special attack to take them down (RAID - rapid array of inexpensive blows )
(Possible D term -> Decks, 
Sonar jammer -> the b@'s sonar is affected
hields

Attacks:
========
Silent Takedown (depends on enemy awareness, turn/impulse management)
Inverted Takedown (How to pull this off?)
Attack for 2 opposing sides. (left and right)
Melee attack with varying effects (such as enemy falling down, confusion for short duration)
Ex: flip attack, lay down 1 enemy to (like /). Next turn is spent by enemy getting up. (DONE)
Probabilistically run these effects when you attack people.
Stun charge shooter in combat
Probabilistic attack power
Disarm (shields/guns) + Disassemble (seperate out the the gun parts and throw them aside.

Jump : provide target location
Launch/Jump/Glide improvement:
1. Limit max dx/dy to some cap (3/9)
Drop causes more damage than launch.

Movement:
========
Wall/Ceiling action:
1. Adj to wall => less/zero impulse consumption + can use batarangs and other equipment
(meaning more stability)
2. Else, higher impulse consumption but can drop. Cant fire etc. You need both hands to hold on to the ceiling. Can't really launch -> need to angle etc.
DONE - added stability component



New Attack Dimensions:
======================
Batarangs (auto/manual target, inventory mgmt, electric version, sonic version(requires time to recharge), sonar version, remote control version)
Explosive Gel (manual trigger, proximity trigger)
BatClaw -> grab and pull enemies/things from afar
Ultra BatClaw -> pull large objects and weak sections off walls
Line launcher -> travel across regions
Smoke bombs

Better level design:
====================
Objects/Environment that interfere with vision and can be used to affect sound and direct debris attack. Stealth play boost.
Larger levels to get the feel.
Missing sections/Corridors to actually use launch/line launchers and strats like enemy boxing.
Larger rooms with walls/pillers in between
Object with inherent height properties
Wall and boundary management -> pretty weak so far -> needs clear ideas -> see: sonar on wall looks the same as the background

Large scale map / plan:
=======================
Each minigame is inside a building etc. Can roam inside a city in overview mode.
You have some equipment you can load up when you go in / or at select floors 
(large veranda's where you can call in a rocket of supplies)
Hostage/Innocent people presence can motivate why you need bash every guy down -> hostage needs to get out that way.
Hidden sections behind weak walls revealed by detective mode/sonar (??)

Player Constraints
==================
Items available for mission
Hostage/Innocent situation -> limits the kind of attacks used
